						My whole life I have been entertained by the prospect of becoming an engineer, just the thought of having a mental image of any given thing and having the tools and resources to make that idea come to light. If you have ever challenged yourself to make something that was outside of your comfort zone and were able to pull it off, that rush of dopamine and that feeling of accomplishment is unparalleled. Since around middle school, I've always been experimenting and making stuff, some of which got me in trouble. Something that I think I've taken for granted, is that I have had access to stuff most teenagers wouldn't normally have access to, such as tools, materials, and the knowledge of how to use them. The feeling of accomplishment, as well as the ability to make things is something that I want to share with others, hence the reason why I made this site.
