						Repairing electronics is easy, all electronics can be fixed in a relatively similar way. All it takes is maybe replacing a few parts, maybe a bit of glue, or maybe soldering a few things. The basic process is the same, the first thing you have to do is restart it and if possible, check for an update. Sometimes your device will just get an error, or get hit by a space ray or something.  I know you think I'm kidding, I'm not, <a class="abody" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaZ_RSt0KP8">Veritasium</a> has a great video on it. With software updates, you can usually do them through settings or one of the ports. Not having up-to-date software can cause all sorts of things like incompatibilities. If that doesn't work it's time to get your hands dirty, well maybe.
