								<a class="abody" href="https://www.ifixit.com/">Ifixit repair guides</a>,

								<a class="abody" href="https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Parts">Ifixit parts</a>- Ifixit is a great electronics repair company that sells high-quality tools, toolsets, and parts for just about everything. In fact I own a 
								<a class="abody" href="https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/Pro-Tech-Toolkit/IF145-307">Pro Tech Toolkit</a>
								 myself so I  can attest to its quality. They even have repair guides and teardown videos to show you how to take it apart and put it back together.
							</li>
							<li>
								<a class="abody" href="https://www.ebay.com/">Ebay</a>- EBay is like a mash-up of the marketplace, craigslist, and Amazon. EBay can be kinda scary, and you have to be careful about whom you are buying from. EBay is a great place to buy cheap parts or even broken electronics that you can fix.
							</li>
							<li>
								<a class="abody" href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>- Amazon is a great place to buy well...anything, anything, and everything! That includes parts for fixing things, the only thing is that it's all cheap Chinese imported stuff. Amazon is my go-to if ifixit doesn't have it, it's second to ifixit because amazon parts are cheaper and just not of the same quality. I recently bought an OLED display for my phone and the display is greenish when at its lowest brightness. So just be careful, though you can return like anything to amazon if it has a return policy, well most of the time.
